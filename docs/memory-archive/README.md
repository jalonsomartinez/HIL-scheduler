# Memory Archive

This folder stores historical documentation that is intentionally excluded from active memory loading.

## Policy
- Active memory lives in `memory-bank/`.
- Archive files are loaded only when historical context is explicitly needed.
- Historical content is preserved here instead of being deleted.

## Current Archive Entries
- `project_plan_legacy.md`: legacy roadmap removed from active memory path.
- `2026-02-19-memory-bank-pre-right-size/`: full snapshot of memory-bank and AGENTS before right-sizing.
