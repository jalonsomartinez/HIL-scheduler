# API Docs / Legacy Examples

This folder contains reference scripts, scratch files, and historical integration examples.

- These files are **not** part of the active HIL Scheduler runtime.
- The active runtime entrypoint is `hil_scheduler.py` in the repository root.
- Active tests live in `tests/`.

Use this folder for API experiments and archived examples only.
